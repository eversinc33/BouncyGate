# HellsGateNim
A quick example of the Hells Gate technique in Nim

All props to smelly__vx (@RtlMateusz) and am0nsec (@am0nsec) for their paper on this technique.
If you would like to learn more about how this works, you can find their paper at the [Vx-Underground Github](https://github.com/vxunderground/VXUG-Papers/tree/main/Hells%20Gate).

I have tested this on recent versions of Windows 10. Some of the undocumented structures may or may not work on older versions.

Requires the [Winim](https://github.com/khchen/winim) library. If you are new to Nim (like me), [byt3bl33d3r's OffensiveNim](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim) is a great place to start.
